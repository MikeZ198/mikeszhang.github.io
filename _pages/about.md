Born and raised in Shanghai, China, I currently work and live in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.

I hold a B.A. degree in English Studies from Shanghai International Studies University, a minor certificate in Journalism and Communication Studies from Fudan University, and an M.S.Sc degree in Corporate Communication from The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [School of Communication, Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.comm.hkbu.edu.hk/comd-www/english/front/index.htm) under the supervision of Prof. Jos BARTELS. Before committing my research student life, I have worked as a research assistant in applied social sciences, a public relations and marketing practitioner in the auto industry, and a junior journalist & editor for a university press.

My research interest lies in organisational communication and organisational identification, with a preference for quantitative methodologies including survey and experiment, as well as computational methods like machine learning and social network analysis. Particularly, I explore the interactional and cross-cultural interplay between employees, managers, organisations, and technologies in the digital era. I also take up interdisciplinary interests (and have active collaborations with some nice people) in organisational behaviour, management information system, consumer behaviour, quantitative marketing, and decision sciences, trying the combine insights from various fields to expand the scope of my focal works.

In addition, I am currently teaching (as a part-time lecturer) a Master's level course in organisational communication in our school.

As a firm disbeliever of "suffer till success", I discourage any form of rote labour. Scholarly progresses would never be made out of the mundane "clock in-clock out" efforts behind office desks, but they come from a mixture of creativity, fortune, and focused efforts sustained by unoccupied cognitive resources. So I keep my "tank of creativity" filled by NOT following inflexible toils.

Apart from my professional life, I love biking, jogging, city-walking, and hiking. (A light dose of) Coffee-making and wine-tasting are also my getaway treats. I am a game enthusiast who has a well collection of PC (mostly on Steam), XBOX, and Nitendo Switch games. I also pet a cute shiba inu dog who currently lives in Shanghai.
