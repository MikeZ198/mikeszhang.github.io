I was born and raised in Shanghai, China, and currently work and live in Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area.

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [School of Communication, Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.comm.hkbu.edu.hk/comd-www/english/front/index.htm) under the supervison of Prof. Jos BARTELS. My research interest lies in organisational communication, particularly the interactional and cross-cultural dynamics between employees, managers, and organisations in the digital era. I also take up interdisciplinary interests (and have active collaborations with some nice people) in organisational behaviour, management information system, quantitative marketing, and decision sciences, trying the combine insights from varied fields to expand the scope of my focal works.

In addition, I am currently teaching (as a part-time lecturer) a Master's level course in organisational communication in our school.

As a firm disbeliever of "suffer till success", I discourage any form of rote labour. Scholarly progresses would never be made out of the mundane "clock in-clock out" efforts behind office desks, but it comes from a mixture of creativity, fortune, and focused efforts sustained by unoccupied cognitive resources. So I keep my "tank of creativity" filled by NOT following mundane toils.
