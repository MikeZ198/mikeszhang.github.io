This book talks about the role of culture in organisational behaviour and communication. Very informative for those who study or conduct research in organisational behaviour, communication, employee relations, and human resource management. It is also beneficial for managers (especially C-suite members) to reconsider the role of (multi-layered) culture in organisation development.
