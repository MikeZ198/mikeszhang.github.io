I got to know this book when I was in a social psychology course, the instructor of which is a friend of Daniel Kahneman, the world-famous economic psychologist and a Nobel Laureate. Sadly, soon after I finished that semester, Prof. Kahneman passed away. The book is probably one of his easiest work to read, and I summarised it as "the lay-person version of how and why the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) works". Basically, the book elaborates on the two cognitive systems human beings operates on, one relies on emotions, whereas the other works with logics and reasonings. Even though many of his claims and the examples he quoted has been disproved, it is still worth reading, especially for those who wish to learn something about congitive psychology.
