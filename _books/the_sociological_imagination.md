This one is VERY painful to read! Not only because it is difficult to understand (apart from the part where the author roasts the educational and research systems), but also it let social science people doubt the value of thier works. Nevertheless, it is worth reading if (and probably only if) you want be a hardcore sociologist or social science researcher.
